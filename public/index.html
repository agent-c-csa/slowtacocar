      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">About Me</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-2">
        I&apos;m passionate about solving challenging problems, so I&apos;m studying
        computer science at the University of Maryland and learning to do just that. I
        fill practically all of my time persuing opportunities that allow me to
        put my skills to use&mdash;the best opportunities are the ones where I
        can try new approaches and talk to people who are smarter than me.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-7">
        I don&apos;t just solve problems though&mdash;I'm also passionate about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/8NgxgzDAaZ8?si=nL96CJhyritiD5fz" target="_blank" class="underline text-gray-700">high-end audio</a>, <a class="underline text-gray-700" href="https://www.instagram.com/slowtacocar/" target="_blank">photography</a>, and I played drums in a rock band for 8 years!

            I distill a wide breadth of end-to-end system design topics into videos that are digestable for a range of audiences.

            Most of the videos require purchasing the course, but one that we published on YouTube and has reached over 700k

          <p class="text-gray-500 mb-2">
            Ticker is a startup offering a secondary market for private equity.
            I turned the founder&apos;s idea into a solution with a trading platform and
            exchange system that would allow users to buy and sell their shares.
            The MVP I built was complete with payment processing, a database,
            and a matching engine for orders.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-500 mb-3">
            Since then, I left to focus more on Kestrel, and Ticker has pivoted
            to a SaaS model for private equity funds.

        Java class, but I later ported it to Swift to make it available on iOS.
        It&apos;s a simple infinite side-scroller and it&apos;s actually decently fun if
        you&apos;re bored!
